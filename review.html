  <h1>Review Note</h1>
   <h1>How AI Tansformed my Teaching-Learning</h1>
  <p>To start with, my belief that AI cannot be used for teaching has been proved wrong. Instead, I came to a firm conclusion that AI can support the teacher in reducing the mundane activities and the time thus saved can be utilized for further learning. Also AI helps us in understanding various complex topics. One very important thing I have identified with AI is the way it is generating various assessment strategies for improving the learning outcomes of the students mapping them with appropriate Bloom’s taxonomy levels.  However, one caution is that the teacher shall go through the material / assessments generated using AI for its correctness before sharing with the students. </p>
